## Details about actions:

#### Change channel

The 'Change channel' action will send a list of number-keys for the channel number, and finally the 'Enter'-key.  The default delay between each key is 1250 ms, but this can be changed in 'Advanced settings'.

*Example: switch to channel '123':*

Will send this list of keys: 'Key 1', 'Key 2', 'Key 3', 'Enter'.


#### Send list of keys

With the 'Send list of keys' action it is possible to send a list of keys, with a short delay between each key.  The default delay between each key is 100 ms, but this can be changed in 'Advanced settings'.  If the delay is too low, the TV might not respond.

For the list of keys, see [here](./keys.md). 

To send the same key several times, add a ```*X``` after the key, where X is the number of times for the key.  To add an extra delay before the next key, just add a number between 1 - 9999. The number is milliseconds.

*Example: Send 'Home', 'Left' and 'Enter':*

```KEY_HOME,KEY_LEFT,KEY_ENTER```

*Example: Set the aspect ratio, increase the volume 10 times, wait 2.5 seconds (2500 ms) and then press play:*

```KEY_16_9,KEY_VOLUP*10,2500,KEY_PLAY```


#### Launch video on YouTube (Samsung, Samsung Encrypted)

To use the 'Launch video on YouTube' action, the YouTube _video id_ must be provided, which is a 11 character long string.  The video id for this link on YouTube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ

is ```aqz-KE-bpKQ```


## Details about Advanced settings:

#### IP address

The IP address of the TV.

Can be updated manually if the TV was not found or if the IP address of the TV has changed. 

For the "Samsung (encrypted)" - device, it is not possible to change the IP address.
 
#### Secure connection (Samsung)

Used to enable a secure connection to the TV. Normally this is set correctly when adding the device.

To repair the secure connection, first set the "Secure connection" to 'off' and save settings, and the set it to 'on' and save settings.

#### Frame TV support

To be able to turn off 'The Frame', enable this.

#### Polling interval for TV status

Interval between each time the status of the TV (on / off) is checked, in seconds.

A value lower than 10 seconds will disable the polling.

#### Maximum volume level

Set the maximum volume level used for UPnP get and set volume.  Default value is 30.

#### Delay between keys

The delay in milliseconds between each key is sent, for the 'Send list of keys' - action.

Default is 100 ms. 

If the value is too low, some or all of the commands might be ignored by the TV.

#### Delay between channel keys

The delay in milliseconds between each key is sent, for the 'Change channel' - action. 

Default is 1250 ms.

#### SmartThings API

To use the SmartThings API, your TV must be logged into your Samsung account.  

Go to https://account.smartthings.com/tokens to generate a token with device access.

Go to advanced settings for the Samsung device, enable SmartThings API and enter the token.

This will enable the 'Set input source' - action.
